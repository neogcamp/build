# Arrays

## beginner - intermediate

1. Find sum of an array and display the output . Example [10,4,5,2,5,6,9].
2. Find average of an array and display the output.
3. Find maximum and minimum of an array.
4. Find Median and Mode of an array.
    - Median : (N+1/2)th term.
    - Mode : Most repeating term
5. Find sum of two arrays.
    - [3,5,2,9,4] = 3+5+2+9+4 = 23
    - [6,2,8,1,3] = 6+2+8+1+3 = 20
    - Final Output : 20+23 = 43
6. Find number of constants and vowels in a string.
7. Shift an array by X to right.
    - Example [1,2,3,4,5] after shifting to right [5,1,2,3,4]
8. Given an array of numbers, pick any two numbers `a`  and `b`, we could get the difference by `Math.abs(a - b)`  . Write a function to get the largest difference in the array.
