# do you know triangles

Let your imagination run wild for this one. Some ideas which you can do. Create a triangle quiz. 


- Ask user to input three angles and you say whether user has entered angles which could make a triangle. Hint: sum of angles in triangle is 180.
- Show three angles to the user and ask if this triangle is an obtuse triangle.
  - do this for right and acute triangles too.
- Show two angles to the user and ask what would be the third angle?
- Similar quiz on Isosceles, Equilateral.
- Ask them to enter two legs and you tell them the hypotenuse.
- Calculator for area of triangle


## practice

- You can make this in CLI and practice different types of input.
- Bonus: If you can make this in vanillaJS or React. You would be able to use different form elements.
- If you do this in routing, use the tabs which we made as markNine assignment. You can make an app which quizzes about triangles, teaches about triangles, and also gives you handy calculator. 
     - make these sections and create a nice app around triangles.
     - keep adding more features and make it pretty!
     
## extrapolate

- Take any geometric figure and do similar things with it. You will get hands on with the operators and end up making useful apps too.
- Once you're done, put all apps at one place and you can send it to your juniors for help.
