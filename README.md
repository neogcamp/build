# build

You completed [levelZero of neogcamp](https://neog.camp/guide) and now you know basics of HTML, CSS, JS & React. Now, you need to code more to get yourself comfortable with what you have just learned. 

This guide will be most useful if you have done my courses, every idea is based on something I have already taught in the video. But if you know the basics you might just enjoy making these apps. 

## principle

- These ideas are not to be taken as a stand alone app. For an internship, these apps might look good on your portfolio, but for full time jobs these are not the app ideas you would want to build. 

- Aim is to get you more practice. Focus is more on basics. Try to do these yourself and if you need help our [Discord server](https://bit.ly/tanaydiscrod) is always there with 14000+ beginner and intermediate programmers like you hanging out together.
